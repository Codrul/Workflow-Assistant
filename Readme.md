# What this project wants to be 

I am making this Workflow Assistant app because I find myself using several inputs for daily activities as a PC user. 

This application should serve as a teaching lesson and probably a tool that I and hopefully others will use regularly.

## Scope
1. Open desktop applications
2. Log into web applications 
3. Have profiles that store credentials and application paths

>Tools that I intend to use:
> 
> Customtkinter, for now 
> 
> JSON files for storing data 
> 

**I will probably update this along the way and hopefully nobody sees it half cooked**
